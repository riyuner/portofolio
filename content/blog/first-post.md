# Welcome to riyuner.id: Let the Adventure Begin!

Every great journey starts with a single step. For me, this blog post is that stepâ€”a digital "Hello, World!" from my corner of the internet.

My name is Rifqi Yuner (you can call me Rifqi), and from my desk here in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, I'm thrilled to finally launch this space. But what exactly is this place?

Think of it as a digital workshop, a personal journal, and an open invitation all rolled into one.

## A Digital Workshop

This is where I'll be tinkering with code, hardware, and everything in between. From building IoT systems with ESP8266 to architecting enterprise Java applications, from defense systems to public transport management platformsâ€”I love diving into the mystery of how things work.

## A Personal Journal

I believe the best way to learn is by doing and documenting the process. I'll be sharing not just the successes, but also the inevitable bugs, the head-scratching frustrations, the sleepless debugging sessions, and those wonderful 'aha!' moments that come with building something new.

Whether it's integrating military sensors, processing MDVR data from Meitrack devices, or getting an ESP8266 to communicate via UDP broadcastâ€”I'll share the real stories, the actual code, and the lessons learned.

## An Open Invitation

More than anything, I hope this blog becomes a place for connection. A space to spark conversations, exchange ideas, and learn from one another.

I'm that engineer who loves both hardware and softwareâ€”tinkering with PC builds and vehicle electronics just as much as architecting distributed systems. If that sounds like your kind of adventure, you're in the right place.

So, whether you're a seasoned developer, a hardware hacker, a curious student, or just someone who loves technology, I'm genuinely glad you're here.

## What's Next?

I've got a backlog of stories to share:
- Building that LED passenger information system with ESP8266
- Lessons from working on Indonesia's defense infrastructure
- The radio simulator that calculates signal range across terrain
- Face recognition systems using vector search
- And so much more...

Grab a cup of your favorite coffee, have a look around, and let's get curious together. The journey is just getting started, and I can't wait to share it with you.

Welcome aboard! ðŸš€
